##Accept a square matrix as input and store it in a variable named matrix. The first line of input will be, nn, the number of rows in the matrix. 
Each of the next nn lines will have a sequence of nn space-separated integers

n=int(input())
matrix=[]
for i in range(n):
    row=[]
    for x in input().split():
        row.append(int(x))
    matrix.append(row)    
print(matrix)
